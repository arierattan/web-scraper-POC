# Web Scraper for Identification Documents - Proof of Concept (PoC)

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a web scraper that collects images of identification documents (ID cards, passports, etc.) from the web, processes them with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and stores the extracted text along with metadata in a local SQLite database.

The tool can be expanded and integrated with other systems for identity verification and monitoring purposes. The primary purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate the feasibility of scraping, downloading, and analyzing identity document images from public sources.

## Features
- Web scraping to gather images of identity documents.
- Downloads images to local storage.
- Uses **Tesseract-OCR** to extract text from the downloaded images.
- Stores image metadata (URL, file path, extracted text) in a local SQLite database.
- Simple configuration and extendable architecture.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - For web scraping.
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - For HTTP requests.
- [Pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) - Python wrapper for Tesseract-OCR.
- [SQLite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) - For storing metadata locally.
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - For image handling.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraper-poc.git
cd web-scraper-poc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain:

```
beautifulsoup4
requests
pytesseract
Pillow
```

### 3. Install Tesseract-OCR

#### For Windows:

- Download and install Tesseract from [this link](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki).
- Ensure Tesseract is added to your system's `PATH`.

#### For Linux (Debian-based distributions):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
```

#### For macOS:

```bash
brew install tesseract
```

### 4. Set Up the Project Directory Structure

Ensure the project directory structure is set up correctly. You can either use the provided directory structure or run the following commands to create the necessary directories and files:

```bash
mkdir -p scraper storage/images ocr data tests utils config
touch scraper/scraper.py scraper/download.py ocr/ocr_processing.py data/metadata.py app.py
```

### 5. Initialize the SQLite Database

The SQLite database file will be created automatically when you run the application, but you can pre-configure it by running:

```python
from data.metadata import initialize_database
initialize_database()
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Scraper

You can run the main scraper application with the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Example Workflow:

1. The scraper fetches images from the specified webpage.
2. Images are downloaded to the `storage/images/` directory.
3. OCR is applied to extract text from each image.
4. Image metadata, including the URL, local file path, and OCR results, are stored in the SQLite database (`data/metadata.db`).

### Optional: View Results with Streamlit (Optional)

You can visualize the results (scraped images and extracted text) with **Streamlit**:

1. Install Streamlit:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run display_app.py
   ```
